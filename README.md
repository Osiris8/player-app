## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Soccer App locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (18.x or higher, as Next.js 15 may require it)
- **npm** or **yarn** (package manager)
- **Git**
- **Postman** (optional, for API testing)
- A **MongoDB** account (e.g., MongoDB Atlas: [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com))
- A **Kinde Authentication** account ([kinde.com](https://kinde.com))
- An **EdgeStore** account ([edgestore.dev](https://edgestore.dev))
- A **Vercel** account for deployment ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com))

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Osiris8/player-app
cd soccer-app
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install
```

If no `package.json` exists, install the core dependencies:

```bash
npm install next@15 @neondatabase/serverless tailwindcss daisyui @edgestore/react @edgestore/next @kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs mongodb
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root to store sensitive configuration:

```bash
touch .env.local  # On Windows: echo. > .env.local
```

Open the `.env.local` file and add the following environment variables, replacing placeholders with your actual values:

```bash
KINDE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_KINDE_CLIENT_ID"
KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET"
KINDE_ISSUER_URL="YOUR_KINDE_ISSUER_URL"
KINDE_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL="http://localhost:3000"
KINDE_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL="http://localhost:3000"
MONGODB_URI="YOUR_MONGODB_URI"
EDGE_STORE_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_EDGE_STORE_ACCESS_KEY"
EDGE_STORE_SECRET_KEY="YOUR_EDGE_STORE_SECRET_KEY"
```

#### How to Obtain Environment Variables:

- **KINDE_CLIENT_ID**, **KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET**, **KINDE_ISSUER_URL**: Obtain from your Kinde Authentication dashboard after creating an app ([kinde.com](https://kinde.com)).
- **KINDE_SITE_URL**, **KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL**, **KINDE_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL**: Use `http://localhost:3000` for local development. Update to your deployed URL (e.g., `https://player-app-kappa.vercel.app`) for production.
- **MONGODB_URI**: Get from your MongoDB Atlas dashboard (e.g., `mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster0.mongodb.net/dbname`).
- **EDGE_STORE_ACCESS_KEY**, **EDGE_STORE_SECRET_KEY**: Create an EdgeStore account at [edgestore.dev](https://edgestore.dev) and obtain these from your project settings.

### 5. Run the Application Locally

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will run on `http://localhost:3000`. Open your browser to view the UI or test API endpoints with Postman.

### 6. Deploy to Vercel

To deploy the app to Vercel:

1. Push your repository to GitHub.
2. Connect your repository to Vercel via the Vercel dashboard.
3. Set the environment variables (listed above) in Vercel‚Äôs project settings.
4. Deploy the project. The app will be available at a URL like `https://player-app-kappa.vercel.app`.

## üß™ Testing with Postman

To test the API endpoints, use **Postman** to send requests to the deployed API (`https://player-app-kappa.vercel.app`) or locally (`http://localhost:3000`). Below are the key endpoints for managing players. Ensure you‚Äôre authenticated via Kinde (include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>` if required).

### 1. Create a Player

- **Method**: POST
- **URL**: `https://player-app-kappa.vercel.app/api/player`
- **Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <your_kinde_jwt_token>` (if authentication is required)
- **Body** (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Lionel Messi",
    "imageUrl": "https://example.com/images/messi.jpg",
    "club": "Inter Miami",
    "country": "Argentina",
    "position": "Forward",
    "age": 37,
    "description": "Widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, known for his exceptional dribbling and playmaking.",
    "history": "Started his career at FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, before making his senior debut in 2004.",
    "career": "FC Barcelona (2004-2021), Paris Saint-Germain (2021-2023), Inter Miami (2023-present)",
    "goals": 819
  }
  ```
- **Response**: Returns the created player with an ID and details.

### 2. Retrieve All Players

- **Method**: GET
- **URL**: `https://player-app-kappa.vercel.app/api/myplayers/yourUserId`
- **Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <your_kinde_jwt_token>` (if authentication is required)
- **Response**: Returns a list of all players.

### 3. Display a Player

- **Method**: GET
- **URL**: `https://player-app-kappa.vercel.app/api/players/your-player-id`
- **Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <your_kinde_jwt_token>` (if authentication is required)
- **Response**: Returns a list of all players.

### 3. Update a Player

- **Method**: PATCH
- **URL**: `https://player-app-kappa.vercel.app/api/player/your-player-id`
- **Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <your_kinde_jwt_token>` (if authentication is required)
- **Body** (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Lionel Messi",
    "imageUrl": "https://example.com/images/messi.jpg",
    "club": "Inter Miami",
    "country": "Argentina",
    "position": "Forward",
    "age": 37,
    "description": "Widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, known for his exceptional dribbling and playmaking.",
    "history": "Started his career at FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, before making his senior debut in 2004.",
    "career": "FC Barcelona (2004-2021), Paris Saint-Germain (2021-2023), Inter Miami (2023-present)",
    "goals": 819
  }
  ```
- **Response**: Returns the updated player. Replace `your-player-id` with the actual player ID.

### 4. Delete a Player

- **Method**: DELETE
- **URL**: `https://player-app-kappa.vercel.app/api/player/your-player-id`
- **Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <your_kinde_jwt_token>` (if authentication is required)
- **Response**: Confirms the player is deleted. Replace `your-player-id` with the actual player ID.

### Notes

- Replace `your-player-id` with the actual ID of the player (obtained from the POST or GET response).
- For local testing, use `http://localhost:3000` instead of the Vercel URL.
- Obtain a JWT token by logging in via Kinde Authentication (e.g., through the app‚Äôs login page or Kinde‚Äôs API).
- If a Postman collection is available in the repository, import it for pre-configured requests.
